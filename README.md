Ad's Keyboard Configs
=====================

Well inevitably I'm now deeply in love with building and modding mechanical keyboards, so this repo contains whatever I'm up to.

This isn't really for public use outside of reference/curiosity, but check out
  - [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) for some super customisable and capable firmware
  - [ErgoMechBoards subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/) for some gorgeous keyboards and great ideas
